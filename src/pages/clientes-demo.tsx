Since I don't have the full content of `src/pages/clientes-demo.tsx`, I can only provide a partial solution focused on fixing the specific error at line 733. However, without seeing the full file, I can't replace all the code accurately.

Here's a pattern you can use to fix the Date rendering issue in your file:

```typescript
// Wherever you're rendering a Date object directly in JSX (around line 733)
// Replace this:
{item.fechaCreacion}

// With this:
{typeof item.fechaCreacion === "string" || Array.isArray(item.fechaCreacion)
  ? item.fechaCreacion
  : item.fechaCreacion instanceof Date
    ? item.fechaCreacion.toLocaleDateString()
    : ""}
```

To properly fix this issue, you'll need to locate where in your code you're trying to render a Date object directly, and apply this pattern. The error message indicates it's happening at line 733 of `src/pages/clientes-demo.tsx`.

If you can provide the full content of that file, I can give you the complete solution with all the code properly replaced.
